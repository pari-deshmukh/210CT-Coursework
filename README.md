# 210CT-Coursework
Programs implemented in Python 2.7 as part of the 210CT Coursework Assignment.

# List of Assignments:
 1. Build a Binary Search Tree (BST) to hold English language words in its nodes. Use a paragraph of any text in order to extract words and to determine their frequencies. Input:  You  should  read  the  paragraph  from  a  suitable  file  format,  such as  .txt.  The  following tree  operations  should  be  implemented: a) Printing  the  tree  in  pre-order.  b)  Finding  a  word. Regardless  whether  found  or  not  found  your  program  should  output  the  path  traversed  in determining the answer, followed by yes if found or no, respectively.
 
 2. Implement a functionthat deletes a node in a binary search treein a language of your choice.
 
 3. Implement  the  structure  for  an  unweighted,  undirected  graph  G,  where  nodes  consist  of positive  integers.  Also,  implement  a  function  isPath(v,  w),  where  v  and w  are  vertices  in  the graph, to check  if there  is a path between the  two nodes. The path found will be  printed to a text file as a sequence of integer numbers (the node values).
 
 4. Using the graph structure previously implemented, implement a function isConnected(G)  to check whether or not the graph is strongly connected. The output should be simply 'yes' or 'no'.
 
 5. Implement BFS and DFS traversals for the above graphstructure. Save the nodes traversed in sequence to a text file.6.Adapt thepreviousgraph structureto support weighted connections and implementDijkstraâ€™salgorithm.
